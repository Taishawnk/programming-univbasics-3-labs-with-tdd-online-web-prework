first_number = 1 
second_number = 1 
sum = first_number + second_number
difference = first_number - second_number
product = first_number * second_number
quotient = first_number /






- The third test is looking for a local variable named `sum`. The `sum` variable
  is the result of adding `first_number` and `second_number` together. This test
  is using all three variables. Not only that, the test is using whatever values
  _you_ assigned to `first_number` and `second_number`.

- The fourth, fifth and sixth tests are similar to the tests for `sum`. Create
  the variable `difference` for subtracting, `product` for multiplying, and
  `quotient` for dividing the `first_number` and `second_number` variables.
