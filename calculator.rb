#- The third test is looking for a local variable named `sum`. The `sum` variable
  #is the result of adding `first_number` and `second_number` together. This test
 # is using all three variables. Not only that, the test is using whatever values
  #_you_ assigned to `first_number` and `second_number`.

#`quotient` for dividing the `first_number` and `second_number` variables.
